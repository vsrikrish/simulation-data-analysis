    "section": "Fitting A Linear Regression Model",
    "text": "Fitting A Linear Regression Model\nLet’s start with a simple example: fitting a linear regression model to simulated data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPositive Control Tests\n\n\n\nSimulating data with a known data-generating process and then trying to obtain the parameters for that process is an important step in any workflow.\n\n\n\nSimulating Data\nThe data-generating process for this example will be: \\[\n\\begin{gather}\ny = 5 + 2x + \\varepsilon \\\\\n\\varepsilon \\sim \\text{Normal}(0, 3),\n\\end{gather}\n\\] where \\(\\varepsilon\\) is so-called “white noise”, which adds stochasticity to the data set. The generated dataset is shown in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Scatterplot of our generated data.\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Specification\nThe statistical model for a standard linear regression problem is \\[\n\\begin{gather}\ny = a + bx + \\varepsilon \\\\\n\\varepsilon \\sim \\text{Normal}(0, \\sigma).\n\\end{gather}\n\\]\nRearranging, we can rewrite the likelihood function as: \\[y \\sim \\text{Normal}(\\mu, \\sigma),\\] where \\(\\mu = a + bx\\). This means that we have three parameters to fit: \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(\\sigma^2\\).\nNext, we need to select priors on our parameters. We’ll use relatively generic distributions to avoid using the information we have (since we generated the data ourselves), but in practice, we’d want to use any relevant information that we had from our knowledge of the problem. Let’s use relatively diffuse normal distributions for the trend parameters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and a half-normal distribution (a normal distribution truncated at 0, to only allow positive values) for the variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), as recommended by Gelman (2006).\n\nGelman, A. (2006). Prior distributions for variance parameters in hierarchical models (comment on article by Browne and Draper). Bayesian Anal., 1(3), 515–533. https://doi.org/10.1214/06-BA117A\n\\[\n\\begin{gather}\na \\sim \\text{Normal(0, 10)} \\\\\nb \\sim \\text{Normal(0, 10)} \\\\\n\\sigma \\sim \\text{Half-Normal}(0, 25)\n\\end{gather}\n\\]\n\n\nUsing Turing\n\nCoding the Model\nTuring.jl uses the @model macro to specify the model function. We’ll follow the setup in the Turing documentation.\nTo specify distributions on parameters (and the data, which can be thought of as uncertain parameters in Bayesian statistics), use a tilde ~, and use equals = for transformations (which we don’t have in this case).\n\n@model function linear_regression(x, y)\n    # set priors\n1    σ ~ truncated(Normal(0, 25); lower=0)\n2    a ~ Normal(0, 10)\n    b ~ Normal(0, 10)\n\n    # compute the likelihood\n3    for i = 1:length(y)\n        # compute the mean value for the data point\n        μ = a + b * x[i]\n        y[i] ~ Normal(μ, σ)\n    end\nend\n\n\n1\n\nStandard deviations must be positive, so we use a normal distribution truncated at zero.\n\n2\n\nWe’ll keep these both relative uninformative to reflect a more “realistic” modeling scenario.\n\n3\n\nIn this case, we specify the likelihood with a loop. We could also rewrite this as a joint likelihood over all of the data using linear algebra, which might be more efficient for large and/or complex models or datasets, but the loop is more readable in this simple case.\n\n\n\n\nlinear_regression (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\n\n\nFitting The Model\nNow we can call the sampler to draw from the posterior. We’ll use the No-U-Turn sampler (Hoffman & Gelman, 2014), which is a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm (a different category of MCMC sampler than the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm discussed in class). We’ll also use 4 chains so we can test that the chains are well-mixed, and each chain will be run for 5,000 iterations11 Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers often need to be run for fewer iterations than Metropolis-Hastings samplers, as the exploratory step uses information about the gradient of the statistical model, versus the random walk of Metropolis-Hastings. The disadvantage is that this gradient information must be available, which is not always the case for external simulation models. Simulation models coded in Julia can usually be automatically differentiated by Turing’s tools, however.\n\nHoffman, M. D., & Gelman, A. (2014). The No-U-Turn sampler: Adaptively setting path lengths in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. J. Mach. Learn. Res., 15(47), 1593–1623.\n\n# set up the sampler\n1model = linear_regression(x, y)\n2n_chains = 4\n3n_per_chain = 5000\n4chain = sample(model, NUTS(), MCMCThreads(), n_per_chain, n_chains, drop_warmup=true)\n5@show chain\n\n\n1\n\nInitialize the model with the data.\n\n2\n\nWe use multiple chains to help diagnose convergence.\n\n3\n\nThis sets the number of iterations for each chain.\n\n4\n\nSample from the posterior using NUTS and drop the iterations used to warmup the sampler. The MCMCThreads() call tells the sampler to use available processor threads for the multiple chains, but it will just sample them in serial if only one thread exists.\n\n5\n\nThe @show macro makes the display of the output a bit cleaner.\n\n\n\n\n┌ Warning: Only a single thread available: MCMC chains are not sampled in parallel\n└ @ AbstractMCMC ~/.julia/packages/AbstractMCMC/F9Hbk/src/sample.jl:296\n\n\n┌ Info: Found initial step size\n└   ϵ = 0.00625\n┌ Info: Found initial step size\n└   ϵ = 0.025\n\n\n┌ Info: Found initial step size\n└   ϵ = 0.2\n┌ Info: Found initial step size\n└   ϵ = 0.003125\n\n\nSampling (1 threads):  50%|██████████████▌              |  ETA: 0:00:00\n\n\nSampling (1 threads): 100%|█████████████████████████████| Time: 0:00:01\n\n\nchain = MCMC chain (5000×15×4 Array{Float64, 3})\n\n\n\nChains MCMC chain (5000×15×4 Array{Float64, 3}):\nIterations        = 1001:1:6000\nNumber of chains  = 4\nSamples per chain = 5000\nWall duration     = 17.6 seconds\nCompute duration  = 14.44 seconds\nparameters        = σ, a, b\ninternals         = lp, n_steps, is_accept, acceptance_rate, log_density, hamiltonian_energy, hamiltonian_energy_error, max_hamiltonian_energy_error, tree_depth, numerical_error, step_size, nom_step_size\nSummary Statistics\n  parameters      mean       std      mcse     ess_bulk     ess_tail      rhat ⋯\n      Symbol   Float64   Float64   Float64      Float64      Float64   Float64 ⋯\n           σ    5.3881    0.9886    0.0097   10835.5758   10595.6871    1.0003 ⋯\n           a    7.3483    2.1028    0.0231    8360.9948    8903.0798    1.0002 ⋯\n           b    1.7993    0.1865    0.0021    8290.7784    8803.3686    1.0003 ⋯\n                                                                1 column omitted\nQuantiles\n  parameters      2.5%     25.0%     50.0%     75.0%     97.5% \n      Symbol   Float64   Float64   Float64   Float64   Float64 \n           σ    3.8905    4.6873    5.2471    5.9322    7.7226\n           a    3.1190    5.9784    7.3761    8.7487   11.4444\n           b    1.4350    1.6773    1.7968    1.9214    2.1732\n\n\n\n\nHow can we interpret the output? The first parts of the summary statistics are straightforward: we get the mean, standard deviation, and Monte Carlo standard error (mcse) of each parameter. We also get information about the effective sample size (ESS)2 and \\(\\hat{R}\\), which measures the ratio of within-chain variance and across-chain variance as a check for convergence3.2 The ESS reflects the efficiency of the sampler: this is an estimate of the equivalent number of independent samples; the more correlated the samples, the lower the ESS.3 The closer \\(\\hat{R}\\) is to 1, the better.\nIn this case, we can see that we were generally able to recover the “true” data-generating values of \\(\\sigma = 4\\) and \\(b = 2\\), but \\(a\\) is slightly off (the mean is 3, rather than the data-generating value of 5). In fact, there is substantial uncertainty about \\(a\\), with a 95% credible interval of \\((3.1, 11.4)\\) (compared to \\((1.4, 2.2)\\) for \\(b\\)). This isn’t surprising: given the variance of the noise \\(\\sigma^2\\), there are many different intercepts which could fit within that spread.\nLet’s now plot the chains for visual inspection.\n\nplot(chain)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Output from the MCMC sampler. Each row corresponds to a different parameter: \\(\\sigma\\), \\(a\\), and \\(b\\). Each chain is shown in a different color. The left column shows the sampler traceplots, and the right column the resulting posterior distributions.\n\n\n\n\nWe can see from Figure 2 that our chains mixed well and seem to have converged to similar distributions! The traceplots have a “hairy caterpiller” appearance, suggesting relatively little autocorrelation. We can also see how much more uncertainty there is with the intercept \\(a\\), while the slope \\(b\\) is much more constrained.\nAnother interesting comparison we can make is with the maximum-likelihood estimate (MLE), which we can obtain through optimization.\n\nmle_model = linear_regression(x, y)\n1mle = optimize(mle_model, MLE())\ncoef(mle)\n\n\n1\n\nThis is where we use the Optim.jl package in this tutorial.\n\n\n\n\n\n3-element Named Vector{Float64}\nA  │ \n───┼────────\nσ  │ 4.75545\na  │ 7.65636\nb  │ 1.77736\n\nWe could also get the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate, which includes the prior density, by replacing MLE() with MAP().\n\n\n\nModel Diagnostics and Posterior Predictive Checks\nOne advantage of the Bayesian modeling approach here is that we have access to a generative model, or a model which we can use to generate datasets. This means that we can now use Monte Carlo simulation, sampling from our posteriors, to look at how uncertainty in the parameter estimates propagates through the model. Let’s write a function which gets samples from the MCMC chains and generates datasets.\n\nfunction mc_predict_regression(x, chain)\n    # get the posterior samples\n1    a = Array(group(chain, :a))\n    b = Array(group(chain, :b))\n    σ = Array(group(chain, :σ))\n\n    # loop and generate alternative realizations\n    μ = a' .+ x * b'\n    y = zeros((length(x), length(a)))\n    for i = 1:length(a)\n        y[:, i] = rand.(Normal.(μ[:, i], σ[i]))\n    end\n    return y\nend\n\n\n1\n\nThe Array(group()) syntax is more general than we need, but is useful if we have multiple variables which were sampled as a group, for example multiple regression coefficients. Otherwise, we can just use e.g. Array(chain, :a).\n\n\n\n\nmc_predict_regression (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nNow we can generate a predictive interval and median and compare to the data.\n\nx_pred = 0:20\ny_pred = mc_predict_regression(x_pred, chain)\n\n21×20000 Matrix{Float64}:\n -0.440341  14.2143    3.73736    3.98402  …  13.9896   12.1475    5.46884\n -7.87522    4.36333  -7.19389    3.34537      9.48413  11.4606    3.81313\n 17.3151     8.9222    0.292523  12.9925       7.6094   11.5593   10.3064\n  2.28767    7.4078    9.09122    9.90026     21.4866   21.4643    4.38994\n 23.1321     9.28746   9.56973   17.9069      14.6245    6.80164  23.3068\n 10.0429    12.6741   23.6552    24.0107   …  17.07     12.9291   19.7511\n 23.3753    33.5452   11.6653    14.3672      21.4006   24.598    25.4434\n 11.6998     7.79426  16.9991    17.8128       8.01083  19.9234   17.2112\n 16.3753    22.476    20.8614    20.1019      15.169    22.8508   21.7635\n 17.1411    14.5313   32.2826    23.3866      27.5636   22.508    19.5266\n 27.7594    28.5052   30.7478    35.5763   …  22.858    27.8321   17.396\n 28.2636    24.2078   23.8358    27.5576      23.1143   30.4325   25.8818\n 35.3991    39.3917   40.5648    30.0351      29.1015   31.9592   38.7204\n 27.9246    34.618    30.7003    31.2341      20.0888   18.9489   24.3442\n 44.3301    21.7205   26.0331    34.8189      34.9326   26.6271   37.492\n 29.0048    45.0313   38.5674    34.2622   …  38.0261   42.037    26.6537\n 38.1531    35.6617   28.2519    36.4022      42.352    38.8477   38.4148\n 41.646     26.0779   38.9314    42.054       30.3764   37.7851   40.6086\n 38.4945    51.9845   42.9168    42.3723      37.3804   47.7923   38.3248\n 37.3901    44.5299   44.5209    46.5456      35.1081   43.7139   47.2316\n 55.3581    41.1191   45.0658    35.4023   …  40.9341   35.7394   36.0986\n\n\nNotice the dimension of y_pred: we have 20,000 columns, because we have 4 chains with 5,000 samples each.

It’s hard to tell with only 20 data points, though! We could resolve this by tightening our priors, but this depends on how much information we used to specify them in the first place. The goal shouldn’t be to hit a specific level of uncertainty, but if there is a sound reason to tighten the priors, we could do so.\nNow let’s look at the residuals from the posterior median and the data. The partial autocorrelations plotted in Figure 4 are not fully convincing, as there are large autocorrelation coefficients with long lags, but the dataset is quite small, so it’s hard to draw strong conclusions. We won’t go further down this rabbit hole as we know our data-generating process involved independent noise, but for a real dataset, we might want to try a model specification with autocorrelated errors to compare.\n\n# calculate the median predictions and residuals\ny_pred_data = mc_predict_regression(x, chain)\ny_med_data = quantile.(eachrow(y_pred_data), 0.5)\nresiduals = y_med_data .- y\n\n# plot the residuals and a line to show the zero\nplot(pacf(residuals, 1:4), line=:stem, marker=:circle, legend=:false, grid=:false, linewidth=2, xlabel=\"Lag\", ylabel=\"Partial Autocorrelation\", markersize=8, tickfontsize=14, guidefontsize=16, legendfontsize=16)\nhline!([0], linestyle=:dot, color=:red)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Partial autocorrelation function of model residuals, relative to the predictive median."

We do this by removing a one-year moving average, centered on the data point, per the recommendation of Arns et al.

We can do this using the groupby, transform, and combine functions from DataFrames.jl, as below.\n\n# calculate the annual maxima\n1dat_ma = dropmissing(dat_ma)\n2dat_annmax = combine(dat_ma -&gt; dat_ma[argmax(dat_ma.residual), :],\n                groupby(transform(dat_ma, :datetime =&gt; x-&gt;year.(x)), :datetime_function))\n3delete!(dat_annmax, nrow(dat_annmax))\n\n# make a histogram of the maxima to see the distribution\nhistogram(dat_annmax.residual, label=false)\nylabel!(\"Count\")\nxlabel!(\"Mean Water Level (mm)\")\n\n\n1\n\nIf we don’t drop the values which are missing, they will affect the next call to argmax.\n\n2\n\nThis first groups the data based on the year (with groupby and using Dates.year() to get the year of each data point), then pulls the rows which correspond to the maxima for each year (using argmax).\n\n3\n\nThis will delete the last year, in this case 2023, because the dataset only goes until March 2023 and this data point is almost certainly an outlier due to the limited data from that year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Histogram of annual block maxima from 1898-2022 from the San Francisco tide gauge dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFit The Model\n\n@model function gev_annmax(y)               \n1    μ ~ Normal(1000, 100)\n2    σ ~ truncated(Normal(0, 100); lower=0)\n3    ξ ~ Normal(0, 0.5)\n\n4    y ~ GeneralizedExtremeValue(μ, σ, ξ)\nend\n\n5gev_model = gev_annmax(dat_annmax.residual)\n6n_chains = 4\n7n_per_chain = 5000\n8gev_chain = sample(gev_model, NUTS(), MCMCThreads(), n_per_chain, n_chains; drop_warmup=true)\n@show gev_chain\n\n\n1\n\nLocation parameter prior: We know that this is roughly on the 1000 mm order of magnitude, but want to keep this relatively broad.\n\n2\n\nScale parameter prior: This parameter must be positive, so we use a normal truncated at zero.\n\n3\n\nShape parameter prior: These are usually small and are hard to constrain, so we will use a more informative prior.\n\n4\n\nThe data is independently GEV-distributed as we’ve removed the long-term trend and are using long blocks.\n\n5\n\nInitialize the model.\n\n6\n\nWe use multiple chains to help diagnose convergence.\n\n7\n\nThis sets the number of iterations for each chain.\n\n8\n\nSample from the posterior using NUTS and drop the iterations used to warmup the sampler.\n\n\n\n\n┌ Warning: Only a single thread available: MCMC chains are not sampled in parallel\n└ @ AbstractMCMC ~/.julia/packages/AbstractMCMC/F9Hbk/src/sample.jl:296\n\n\n┌ Info: Found initial step size\n└   ϵ = 0.2\n┌ Info: Found initial step size\n└   ϵ = 0.0125\n\n\n┌ Info: Found initial step size\n└   ϵ = 0.2\n┌ Info: Found initial step size\n└   ϵ = 0.2\n\n\nSampling (1 threads):  50%|██████████████▌              |  ETA: 0:00:03\n\n\nSampling (1 threads): 100%|█████████████████████████████| Time: 0:00:06\n\n\ngev_chain = MCMC chain (5000×15×4 Array{Float64, 3})\n\n\n\nChains MCMC chain (5000×15×4 Array{Float64, 3}):\nIterations        = 1001:1:6000\nNumber of chains  = 4\nSamples per chain = 5000\nWall duration     = 13.26 seconds\nCompute duration  = 12.89 seconds\nparameters        = μ, σ, ξ\ninternals         = lp, n_steps, is_accept, acceptance_rate, log_density, hamiltonian_energy, hamiltonian_energy_error, max_hamiltonian_energy_error, tree_depth, numerical_error, step_size, nom_step_size\nSummary Statistics\n  parameters        mean       std      mcse     ess_bulk     ess_tail      rh ⋯\n      Symbol     Float64   Float64   Float64      Float64      Float64   Float ⋯\n           μ   1257.8174    5.6701    0.0513   12216.6653   12642.3312    1.00 ⋯\n           σ     57.1982    4.3214    0.0366   14201.5441   12575.6044    1.00 ⋯\n           ξ      0.0292    0.0625    0.0008    5915.1552    7463.8803    1.00 ⋯\n                                                               2 columns omitted\nQuantiles\n  parameters        2.5%       25.0%       50.0%       75.0%       97.5% \n      Symbol     Float64     Float64     Float64     Float64     Float64 \n           μ   1246.8628   1253.9821   1257.8132   1261.6027   1269.2078\n           σ     49.4284     54.1859     56.9353     59.9665     66.3174\n           ξ     -0.0811     -0.0151      0.0250      0.0699      0.1627\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(gev_chain)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Traceplots (left) and marginal distributions (right) from the MCMC sampler for the GEV model.\n\n\n\n\nFrom Figure 8, it looks like all of the chains have converged to the same distribution; the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic is also close to 1 for all parameters.

This makes some intuitive sense, as increasing the location parameter shifts the bulk of the distribution in a positive direction, and the increasing scale parameter then increases the likelihood of lower values. However, if these parameters are increased, the shape parameter \\(\\xi\\) decreases, as the tail of the GEV does not need to be as thick due to the increased proximity of outliers to the bulk."

    "section": "Data Types",
    "text": "Data Types\nEach datum (importantly, not the variable which is bound to it) has a data type. Julia types are similar to C types, in that they require not only the type of data (Int, Float, String, etc), but also the precision (which is related to the amount of memory allocated to the variable). Issues with precision won’t be a big deal in this class, though they matter when you’re concerned about performance vs. decimal accuracy of code.\nYou can identify the type of a variable or expression with the typeof() function.\n\ntypeof(\"This is a string.\")\n\nString\n\n\n\ntypeof(x)\n\nInt64\n\n\n\nNumeric types\nA key distinction is between an integer type (or Int) and a floating-point number type (or float). Integers only hold whole numbers, while floating-point numbers correspond to numbers with fractional (or decimal) parts. For example, 9 is an integer, while 9.25 is a floating point number. The difference between the two has to do with the way the number is stored in memory. 9, an integer, is handled differently in memory than 9.0, which is a floating-point number, even though they’re mathematically the same value.\n\ntypeof(9)\n\nInt64\n\n\n\ntypeof(9.25)\n\nFloat64\n\n\nSometimes certain function specifications will require you to use a Float variable instead of an Int. One way to force an Int variable to be a Float is to add a decimal point at the end of the integer.\n\ntypeof(9.)\n\nFloat64\n\n\n\n\nStrings\nStrings hold characters, rather than numeric values. Even if a string contains what seems like a number, it is actually stored as the character representation of the digits. As a result, you cannot use arithmetic operators (for example) on this datum.\n\n\"5\" + 5\n\nLoadError: MethodError: no method matching +(::String, ::Int64)\n\u001b[0mClosest candidates are:\n\u001b[0m  +(::Any, ::Any, \u001b[91m::Any\u001b[39m, \u001b[91m::Any...\u001b[39m) at operators.jl:591\n\u001b[0m  +(\u001b[91m::T\u001b[39m, ::T) where T&lt;:Union{Int128, Int16, Int32, Int64, Int8, UInt128, UInt16, UInt32, UInt64, UInt8} at int.jl:87\n\u001b[0m  +(\u001b[91m::T\u001b[39m, ::Integer) where T&lt;:AbstractChar at char.jl:237\n\u001b[0m  ...\n\n\nHowever, you can try to tell Julia to interpret a string encoding a numeric character as a numeric value using the parse() function. This can also be used to encode a numeric data as a string.\n\nparse(Int64, \"5\") + 5\n\n10\n\n\nTwo strings can be concatenated using *:\n\n\"Hello\" * \" \" * \"there\"\n\n\"Hello there\"\n\n\n\n\nBooleans\nBoolean variables (or Bools) are logical variables, that can have true or false as values.\n\nb = true\n\ntrue\n\n\nNumerical comparisons, such as ==, !=, or &lt;, return a Bool.\n\nc = 9 &gt; 11\n\nfalse\n\n\nBools are important for logical flows, such as if-then-else blocks or certain types of loops."

    "section": "Functions",
    "text": "Functions\nA function is an object which accepts a tuple of arguments and maps them to a return value. In Julia, functions are defined using the following syntax.\n\nfunction my_actual_function(x, y)\n    return x + y\nend\nmy_actual_function(3, 5)\n\n8\n\n\nFunctions in Julia do not require explicit use of a return statement. They will return the last expression evaluated in their definition. However, it’s good style to explicitly return function outputs. This improves readability and debugging, especially when functions can return multiple expressions based on logical control flows (if-then-else blocks).\nFunctions in Julia are objects, and can be treated like other objects. They can be assigned to new variables or passed as arguments to other functions.\n\ng = my_actual_function\ng(3, 5)\n\n8\n\n\n\nfunction function_of_functions(f, x, y)\n    return f(x, y)\nend\nfunction_of_functions(g, 3, 5)\n\n8\n\n\n\nShort and Anonymous Functions\nIn addition to the long form of the function definition shown above, simple functions can be specified in more compact forms when helpful.\nThis is the short form:\n\nh₁(x) = x^2 # make the subscript using \\_1 + &lt;TAB&gt;\nh₁(4)\n\n16\n\n\nThis is the anonymous form:\n\nx-&gt;sin(x)\n(x-&gt;sin(x))(π/4)\n\n0.7071067811865475\n\n\n\n\nMutating Functions\nThe convention in Julia is that functions should not modify (or mutate) their input data. The reason for this is to ensure that the data is preserved. Mutating functions are mainly appropriate for applications where performance needs to be optimized, and making a copy of the input data would be too memory-intensive.\nIf you do write a mutating function in Julia, the convention is to add a ! to its name, like my_mutating_function!(x).\n\n\nOptional arguments\nThere are two extremes with regard to function parameters which do not always need to be changed. The first is to hard-code them into the function body, which has a clear downside: when you do want to change them, the function needs to be edited directly. The other extreme is to treat them as regular arguments, passing them every time the function is called. This has the downside of potentially creating bloated function calls, particularly when there is a standard default value that makes sense for most function evaluations.\nMost modern languages, including Julia, allow an alternate solution, which is to make these arguments optional. This involves setting a default value, which is used unless the argument is explicitly defined in a function call.\n\nfunction setting_optional_arguments(x, y, c=0.5)\n    return c * (x + y)\nend\n\nsetting_optional_arguments (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nIf we want to stick with the fixed value \\(c=0.5\\), all we have to do is call setting_optional_arguments with the x and y arguments.\n\nsetting_optional_arguments(3, 5)\n\n4.0\n\n\nOtherwise, we can pass a new value for c.\n\nsetting_optional_arguments(3, 5, 2)\n\n16\n\n\n\n\nPassing data structures as arguments\nInstead of passing variables individually, it may make sense to pass a data structure, such as an array or a tuple, and then unpacking within the function definition. This is straightforward in long form: access the appropriate elements using their index.\nIn short or anonymous form, there is a trick which allows the use of readable variables within the function definition.\n\nh₂((x,y)) = x*y # enclose the input arguments in parentheses to tell Julia to expect and unpack a tuple\n\nh₂ (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\nh₂((2, 3)) # this works perfectly, as we passed in a tuple\n\n6\n\n\n\nh₂(2, 3) # this gives an error, as h₂ expects a single tuple, not two different numeric values\n\nLoadError: MethodError: no method matching h₂(::Int64, ::Int64)\n\u001b[0mClosest candidates are:\n\u001b[0m  h₂(::Any) at In[50]:1\n\n\n\nh₂([3, 10]) # this also works with arrays instead of tuples\n\n30\n\n\n\n\nVectorized operations\nJulia uses dot syntax to vectorize an operation and apply it element-wise across an array.\nFor example, to calculate the square root of 3:\n\nsqrt(3)\n\n1.7320508075688772\n\n\nTo calculate the square roots of every integer between 1 and 5:\n\nsqrt.([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n\n5-element Vector{Float64}:\n 1.0\n 1.4142135623730951\n 1.7320508075688772\n 2.0\n 2.23606797749979\n\n\nThe same dot syntax is used for arithmetic operations over arrays, since these operations are really functions.\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4] .* 2\n\n4-element Vector{Int64}:\n 2\n 4\n 6\n 8\n\n\nVectorization can be faster and is more concise to write and read than applying the same function to multiple variables or objects explicitly, so take advantage!\n\n\nReturning multiple values\nYou can return multiple values by separating them with a comma. This implicitly causes the function to return a tuple of values.\n\nfunction return_multiple_values(x, y)\n    return x + y, x * y\nend\nreturn_multiple_values(3, 5)\n\n(8, 15)\n\n\nThese values can be unpacked into multiple variables.\n\nn, ν = return_multiple_values(3, 5)\nn\n\n8\n\n\n\nν\n\n15\n\n\n\n\nReturning nothing\nSometimes you don’t want a function to return any values at all. For example, you might want a function that only prints a string to the console.\n\nfunction print_some_string(x)\n    println(\"x: $x\")\n    return nothing\nend\nprint_some_string(42)\n\nx: 42"

These types of flows include conditional if-then-else statements or loops.\n\nConditional Blocks\nConditional blocks allow different pieces of code to be evaluated depending on the value of a boolean expression or variable. For example, if we wanted to compute the absolute value of a number, rather than using abs():\n\nfunction our_abs(x)\n    if x &gt;= 0\n        return x\n    else\n        return -x\n    end\nend\n\nour_abs (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\nour_abs(4)\n\n4\n\n\n\nour_abs(-4)\n\n4\n\n\nTo nest conditional statements, use elseif.\n\nfunction test_sign(x)\n    if x &gt; 0\n        return Text(\"x is positive.\")\n    elseif x &lt; 0\n        return Text(\"x is negative.\")\n    else\n        return Text(\"x is zero.\")\n    end\nend\n\ntest_sign (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\ntest_sign(-5)\n\nx is negative.\n\n\n\ntest_sign(0)\n\nx is zero.\n\n\n\n\nLoops\nLoops allow expressions to be evaluated repeatedly until they are terminated. The two main types of loops are while loops and for loops.\n\nWhile loops\nwhile loops continue to evaluate an expression so long as a specified boolean condition is true. This is useful when you don’t know how many iterations it will take for the desired goal to be reached.\n\nfunction compute_factorial(x)\n    factorial = 1\n    while (x &gt; 1)\n        factorial *= x\n        x -= 1\n    end\n    return factorial\nend\ncompute_factorial(5)\n\n120\n\n\n\nWhile loops can easily turn into infinite loops if the condition is never meaningfully updated. Be careful, and look there if your programs are getting stuck. Also, If the expression in a while loop is false when the loop is reached, the loop will never be evaluated.\n\n\n\nFor loops\nfor loops run for a finite number of iterations, based on some defined index variable.\n\nfunction add_some_numbers(x)\n    total_sum = 0 # initialize at zero since we're adding\n    for i=1:x # the counter i is updated every iteration\n        total_sum += i\n    end\n    return total_sum\nend\nadd_some_numbers(4)\n\n10\n\n\nfor loops can also iterate over explicitly passed containers, rather than iterating over an incrementally-updated index sequence. Use the in keyword when defining the loop.\n\nfunction add_passed_numbers(set)\n    total_sum = 0\n    for i in set # this is the syntax we use when we want i to correspond to different container values\n        total_sum += i\n    end\n    return total_sum\nend\nadd_passed_numbers([1, 3, 5])\n\n9"

If any special accomodations would help you navigate any barriers and improve your chances of success, please exercise your right to those accomodations and reach out to me as early as possible with your Student Disability Services (SDS) accomodation letter. This will ensure that we have enough time to make appropriate arrangements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you need more immediate accomodations, but do not yet have a letter, please let me know and then follow up with SDS.\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse Communications\nMost course communications will occur via Ed Discussion. Public Ed posts are generally preferred to private posts or emails, as other students can benefit from the discussions. If you would like to discuss something privately, please do reach out through email or a private Ed post (which will only be viewable by you and the course staff).\nAnnouncements will be made on the course website and in Ed. Emergency announcements will also be made on Canvas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEd Tips\n\n\n\n\nIf you wait until the day an assignment is due (or even late the previous night) to ask a question on Ed, there is a strong chance that I will not see your post prior to the deadline.\nBut if you see unanswered questions and you have some insight, please answer! This class will work best when we all work together as a community.\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health Resources\nWe all have to take care of our mental health, just as we would our physical health. As a student, you may experience a range of issues which can negatively impact your mental health. Please do not ignore any of these stressors, or feel like you have to navigate these challenges alone! You are part of a community of students, faculty, and staff, who have a responsibility to look for one another’s well-being. If you are struggling with managing your mental health, or if you believe a classmate may be struggling, please reach out to the course instructor, the TA, or, for broader support, please take advantage of Cornell’s mental health resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health And This Class\n\n\n\nI am not a trained counselor, but I am here to support you in whatever capacity we can. You should never feel that you need to push yourself past your limits to complete any assignment for this class or any other. If we need to make modifications to the course or assignment schedule, you can certainly reach out to me, and all relevant discussions will be kept strictly confidential."

    "text": "Course Policies\n\nAttendance\nAttendance is not required, but in general, students who attend class regularly will do better and get more out of the class than students who do not. Your class participation grade will reflect both the quantity and quality of your participation, only some of which can occur asynchronously. I will put as many course materials, such as lecture notes and announcements, as possible online, but viewing materials online is not the same as active participation and engagement. Life happens, of course, and this may lead you to miss class. Let me know if you need any appropriate arrangements ahead of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat If I’m Sick?\n\n\n\nPlease stay home if you’re feeling sick! This is beneficial for both for your own recovery and the health and safety of your classmates. We will also make any necessary arrangements for you to stay on top of the class material and if whatever is going on will negatively impact your grade, for example by causing you to be unable to submit an assignment on time.\n\n\n\n\nMask Policies\nMasks are encouraged but not required in the classroom, per university policy. However, the University strongly encourages compliance with requests to mask from students, faculty, and staff who are concerned about the risk of infection. Please be respectful of these concerns and requests if you cannot wear a mask.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasks Will Be Required In My Office\n\n\n\nI will require masks to be worn in my office or during in-person office hours, as we are necessarily interacting in close quarters without great airflow.\n\n\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat, copy, or plagiarize!\n\n\n\nThis class is designed to encourage collaboration, and students are encouraged to discuss their work with other students. However, I expect students to abide by the Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity in all aspects of this class. All work submitted must represent the students’ own work and understanding, whether individually or as a group (depending on the particulars of the assignment). This includes analyses, code, software runs, and reports. Engineering as a profession relies upon the honesty and integrity of its practitioners (see e.g. the American Society for Civil Engineers’ Code of Ethics).\n\n\nExternal Resources\nThe collaborative environment in this class should not be viewed as an invitation for plagiarism. Plagiarism occurs when a writer intentionally misrepresents another’s words or ideas (including code!) as their own without acknowledging the source. All external resources which are consulted while working on an assignment should be referenced, including other students and faculty with whom the assignment is discussed. You will never be penalized for consulting an external source for help and referencing it, but plagiarism will result in a zero for that assignment as well as the potential for your case to be passed on for additional disciplinary action.\n\n\nAI/ML Resource Policy\nAs noted, all work submitted for a grade in this course must reflect your own understanding. The use and consulation of AI/ML tools, such as ChatGPT or similar, must be pre-approved and clearly referenced. If approved, you must:\n\nreference the URL of the service you are using, including the specific date you accessed it;\nprovide the exact query or queries used to interact with the tool; and\nreport the exact response received.\n\nFailure to attain prior approval or fully reference the interaction, as described above, will be treated as plagiarism and referred to the University accordingly.\n\n\nLate Work Policy\nIn general, late work will be subjected to a 10% penalty per day, which can accumulate to 100% of the total grade. However, sometimes things come up in life. Please reach out ahead of time if you have extenuating circumstances (including University-approved absences or illnesses) which would make it difficult for you to submit your work on time. Work which would be late for appropriate reasons will be given extensions and the late penalty will be waived."

    "text": "Assessments\n\nApplication Exercises: 10%\nMost weeks, students will be given a set of exercises (typically involving analyzing a dataset, a model, or a figure, or an overview to a new Julia package) to complete. These will involve a small amount of programming or visual assessment of data or a figure. Application exercises will be provided the previous Friday and are intended to align with the content for the week, and solutions should be submitted by 9:00pm on the Friday at the end of the given week. Application exercise solutions should be submitted as a PDF on Gradescope. The lowest two of these will be dropped. Application exercises which involve programming will be distributed using GitHub Classroom.\n\n\nHomework Assignments: 50%\nApproximately 6 homework assignments will be assigned throughout the semester (roughly one per course module). You will typically have 2 weeks to work on each assignment, though this depends on the module length. Students are encouraged to collaborate and learn from each other on homework assignments, but each student must submit their own solutions reflecting their understanding of the material. Consulting and referencing external resources and your peers is encouraged (engineering is a collaborative discipline!), but plagiarism is a violation of academic integrity.\nSome notes on assignment and grading logistics:\n\nHomework assignments will be distributed using GitHub Classroom. Students should make sure they update their GitHub repositories as they work on the assignments; this helps with answering questions and gives you a backstop in case something goes wrong and you can’t submit your assignment on time.\nHomeworks are due by 9:00pm Eastern Time on the designed due date. Your assignment notebook (which include your writeup and codes) should be submitted to Gradescope as a PDF with the answers to each question tagged (a failure to do this will result in deductions).\nRubrics will be provided for the homeworks as part of the assignments.\nStudents in 5850 will be asked to complete additional homework problems which go more deeply into the\nYour lowest homework grade will be dropped. We can discuss arrangements if multiple assignments will be missed for university-approved reasons, preferably ahead of time.\nRegrade requests for specific problems must be made within a week of the grading of that assignment. However, note that regrades can cut both ways: the TA can take away points as well!\n\n\n\nFinal Term Project: 40%\nThis course will culminate with a term project. The goal of this project is to apply and extend the tools and approaches we will learn in class. While we encourage drawing on other classes or interests when developing and working on your project, submitting work from another course or work which was completed prior to the course is not permitted.\nThe term project will be completed in small groups (2-3 students) for students enrolled in BEE 4850 and individually for those in BEE 5850. The final deliverable for this project will be a poster summarizing the project and results. Ahead of that, you will submit the following:\n\na proposal for feedback on the scope of your project; and\na mid-semester work plan providing more details on the project design.\n\nRubrics will be provided for the components of the project."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Understanding data is an increasingly integral part of working with environmental systems. Data analysis is an integral part of developing statistical and numerical models to understand system dynamics and project future conditions and outcomes. Simulation from models can represent alternative datasets consistent with a set of assumptions about the underlying data-generating process, facilitating model assessment and hypothesis testing. This course will provide an overview of a generative approach to environmental data analysis, which uses simulation and assessments of predictive performance to provide insight into the structure of data and its data-generating process. The goal is to provide students with a framework and an initial toolkit of methods that they can use to formulate and update hypotheses about data and models. In particular, we will:\n\nlearn how to effectively use and critique data visualizations;\ninterpret graphical and quantitative summaries of counterfactual simulations;\ncalibrate statistical and numerical models to reflect data-generating processes;\napply statistical methods to simulate pseudodata from calibrated models;\nassess and select models based on predictive performance; and\nemulate computationally-complex simulations with surrogate models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJulia\n\n\n\nThis course will use the Julia programming language. No prior knowledge of Julia is required."
